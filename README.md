my first repository ; part of GitHub's Hello World guide


I am Lukas Houpt and I think everybody is brilliant. I'm inspired by edTech as a scalable area to unlock human potential everywhere. Apart from education, I'm passionate about climate change and other social issues. Outside of work I love walking my dog and getting outside in any capacity, especially backpacking, kayaking, and skiing. Shoot me a message to say hi!
